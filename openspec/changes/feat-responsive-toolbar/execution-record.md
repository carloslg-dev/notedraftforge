## Decisions made

- Initialize `useMediaQuery` state synchronously using `window.matchMedia(query).matches` to prevent initial render mismatch in react lifecycle.
- Remove Tiptap editor border and margins on mobile devices to prevent double borders.
- Switch layout to full bleed width (100% width, no margins, rounded corners, card borders or card shadows) on mobile devices to optimize horizontal reading and writing space.
- Minimize vertical heights of headers, navbars and metadata blocks to leave maximum space for creative input.
- Remove redundant labels "Reading Preview" and "Edit Piece (Editable)" inside panels to keep flow clean.
- Implement window `visualViewport` event listener to calculate virtual keyboard height dynamically on mobile, shifting toolbar bottom offsets to stay `16px` above the keyboard.
- Shrink mobile visualization toolbar buttons (Intent, Comment, Breath) to icon-only variants, giving full clearance to the "Ajustar" button.
- Create unified `getMenuButtonProps` event helper to intercept pointerdown (`onPointerDown`) and mousedown (`onMouseDown`) events and call `e.preventDefault()`. This blocks the native touch focus shift to the toolbar buttons, keeping the editor focused and preserving the text selection for sequential style applications.
- Run style updates on `onClick` handlers to ensure the browser registers actions inside a valid user-initiated gesture context, allowing programmatic focus to succeed.
- Introduce `showMobileToolbar` state with a `500ms` hide debounce timer. If selections undergo transient updates (such as during style toggling), the toolbar remains stably visible.
- Remove the "Ajustar" (Refine) button entirely from editing mode (both desktop BubbleMenu and mobile keyboard-docked toolbar) to simplify formatting UX, retaining it exclusively in visualization mode for annotation precision.
- Discard all editor-level floating bubble menus, custom mobile bottom menus, and visual viewport listeners, replacing them with a permanently visible vertical sidebar on the right margin of the editor canvas. This provides a clean interface that never conflicts with native mobile selection menus or virtual keyboards, and stays sticky during scroll events.

## Retrospective summary

- Initializing hooks that check browser window states (like media queries) with static defaults (like `false`) can cause flickering, layout shifts, or react hydration/plugin mismatch errors on mount. Always resolve them synchronously when window is available.
- Headless test runners can sometimes fail to emit selection change events natively on simulated viewports. Manual dispatching of DOM events ensures event listeners fire predictably.
- Touch events on mobile trigger default focus transitions that differ from mouse events. Overriding touch start events via `preventDefault` is essential to maintain text selection ranges during editor interactions.
- Programmatic focus calls in iOS Safari are blocked if user-initiated pointer sequences are canceled. Resolving focus commands within standard `click` events bypasses this safety check cleanly.
- Adding a short debounce delay to floating mobile toolbars prevents layout flickering caused by temporary state changes during formatting actions.
- Discarding unnecessary refinement flows from the main editor reduces component complexity, cleans up code hooks, and simplifies the learning curve of formatting controls for users.
- Relocating formatting buttons to a right-aligned static vertical toolbar completely removes overlapping concerns with mobile OS menu bubbles, providing a robust layout for both mobile and web viewports.
