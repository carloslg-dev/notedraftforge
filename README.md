# NoteDraftForge

**NoteDraftForge** is a modular creative workspace designed to organize, structure and version all kinds of content — songs, poems, chapters, notes or any text-based work.  
It focuses on block-based composition, creative branching, and flexible reorganization, offering a lightweight approach that works entirely on the client side.

This project starts as an Angular application using mocked data, with a long-term vision of supporting local files, cloud storage (Google Drive, GitHub repositories), snapshots for print-ready compilations, and optional AI-assisted suggestions.

## ✨ Core Concepts

### **Block-Based Structure**
Content is organized into blocks (sections, lines, tokens).  
This allows:
- Reordering any part of a song or text  
- Editing by segments instead of long documents  
- Building alternative versions easily

### **Creative Branching**
Inspired by Git workflows:
- Create alternate versions of chapters or songs  
- Experiment without losing the original  
- Merge, split or compare versions visually

### **Snapshots**
Generate custom compilations:
- Songbooks  
- Poem collections  
- Manuscript drafts  
- Mixed content sets  

Snapshots can combine multiple pieces and export them in print-friendly format.

### **Song Support**
For musicians, NoteDraftForge supports:
- Chords  
- Melody hints  
- Multilingual lyrics  
- Chord-change highlighting  
- Rhythm and style metadata

Perfect for learning, rehearsing, or sharing versions with bandmates.

### **Poems & Chapters**
Writers can structure chapters or poem stanzas into reusable modular units, making it easier to:
- Test narrative order  
- Branch into alternate scenes  
- Rebuild a manuscript dynamically

## 🧩 Planned Features

- Local file loading (JSON / Excel-like structures)
- Cloud sync via Google Drive or GitHub repositories
- Multi-user collaboration through abstracted Git branching
- Version comparison and merge suggestions
- AI tools:
  - Chord progression suggestions
  - Text variation proposals
  - Snapshot composition assistance
- PWA support for mobile editing

## 🚀 Tech Stack (initial)

- **Angular**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Angular Material** (UI)
- **Mocked JSON data** as the initial content provider
- **Modular architecture** for future backend integration (Java, Node, or serverless optional)
