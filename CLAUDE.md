# CLAUDE.md — NoteDraftForge

## Start here

`AGENTS.md` is the common contract for all agents: workflow, scripts, hard constraints.
This file (`CLAUDE.md`) adds Claude Code-specific behavior on top of that contract.

Before any task, read in this order:
1. `AGENTS.md` — common agent contract (workflow, scripts, constraints)
2. `openspec/project.md` — project orientation and specs index
3. `docs/ai/workflow.md` — mandatory agent phases (PLAN → CONTEXT → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → REVIEW → RETRO)

## Project in one line

Private-first Markdown editor for poems, songs, and structured text.
Annotations (chord, meter, breath, intention, comment) are attached to anchor zones in the text.
Visualization uses pre-rendered snapshots with CSS-toggled layers.

## Key constraints

- **SDD: no code without a spec.** Every implementation must reference a `openspec/specs/<feature>/spec.md`.
- **DDD + Hexagonal Architecture.** `core/domain/` must have zero dependencies on Angular, IndexedDB, or any framework.
- **No backend, no sync, no AI features in MVP.**
- **Angular + IndexedDB + GitHub Pages.** No other stack choices in MVP.

## Commit convention

Conventional Commits in English: `type(scope): message`

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(annotation): add needsReview resolution flow`
- `fix(snapshot): prevent duplicate regeneration on toggle`
